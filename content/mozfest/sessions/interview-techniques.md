A 30 minute conversation around how we can ask better questions. 
<!--more-->
Philip takes what he has learned about HR in a corporate environment and will share his insights. He likes to hold conversations, rather than interviews, as a hiring manager, with a focus on "soft skills".
This is more about public speaking, interviewing in a host guest scenario and less about a professional job interview... although one could say that the experience across scenarios could be quite similar and draw parallels as far as learnings or tips/tricks. Come for a casual but insightful chat!
