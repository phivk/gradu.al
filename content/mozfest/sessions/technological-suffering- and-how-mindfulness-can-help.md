There are some aspects of our digital world, our relationships with devices, and how we relate to one another digitally that are contributing to individual and societal suffering.

That suffering can start small. But left unchecked, unexplored, unmanaged, this suffering will perpetuate and increase.
Maria Bridge has spent >2000 hours of meditating on how the human mind works, and how some of the features of technology are accelerating human suffering. In this presentation, she’ll share what she has learned and facilitate a conversation around it.
