Want to grow a passionate community online? What does a 'healthy community' even mean?
<!--more-->
Building a community requires providing a lot of value, and being responsive to that community. Gracielle and Michelle will facilitate a brainstorm session around fostering and nurturing a human-centered community online, making use of a collective miro board. Feel welcome if you'd like to learn more or have any insights to share to add to the conversation! Or just bring a drink for a fun Saturday get-together.
