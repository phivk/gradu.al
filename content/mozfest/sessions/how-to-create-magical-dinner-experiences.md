This adventure begins somewhere with a mysterious letter and ends somewhere in a forest with delicious food.

A few years ago, Thomas Steigenga was one of the people who started 'wilddineren', which provides the type of luxury he refers to in guerrilla dining events across the Netherlands, each of which takes place in a different location that is revealed only on the day of the event.
Previous escapades had been hosted in the toilets of a music venue, in a public train during rush hour and in the boiler room of the former Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Thomas will share what he has learned during the hosting of these events and how we can use it to create our own magical dinner experiences during times of lockdown.
