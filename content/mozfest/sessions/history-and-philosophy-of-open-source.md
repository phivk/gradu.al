Whether you're a weathered veteran or completely new to the world of Open Source - there's always something new to learn.

<!--more-->

Tom and Omar will share a quick historical overview, the foundations with the Open Source Initiative (OSI) and offer different perspectives.
Links will be made with the field of philosophy, critical theory / social justice ideas to get a broad view of how it relates to current open source ideas: into other fields such as education (OER, open access), open science, open development, open gov and open data.  
Omar will also start a conversation around the burden of maintaining software, and how contributing code can actually (and often?) cause more trouble than it helps (especially for one-off contributions).
