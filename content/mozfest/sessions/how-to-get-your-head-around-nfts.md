A non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique.
<!--more-->
NFTs are called non-fungible because they are not mutually interchangeable, since they contain unique information, although it is possible to mint any number of NFTs representing the same object. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and many network or utility tokens that are fungible in nature.
Still confused? Don't worry - Douglas will facilitate a peer sharing session so that we can all get our heads around everything that has just been explained.
