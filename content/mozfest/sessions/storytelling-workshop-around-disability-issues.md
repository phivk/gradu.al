A 21st-century retelling of a 19th-century story about two people...
<!--more-->
...Each with different neurological conditions, who bond despite social differences of age, gender and class. They both experience social isolation because of their conditions. The original story has a sad ending, which can be subverted through our collective retelling. The message of bonding despite social barriers and using this bond to help manage everyday life with neurological conditions is still really important. Christine wants to give them a chance for a different ending -- give them options! -- and also update the language.
During this session we may go deeper into psychological motivations and feelings around themes of disability, hence this session may trigger painful memories for some people.
