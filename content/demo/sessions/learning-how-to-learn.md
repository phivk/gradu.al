The ability to learn is one of humanity’s greatest gifts.. And yet we are rarely taught how to learn. 
<!--more-->
We’ll learn about how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates information. We’ll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects. Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life.
