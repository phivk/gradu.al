bio: "I'm a teacher/civic activist, I value openness and sharing the treasure we have within us to learn. I advocate for open movements, web-literacy, web-making, and internet health. My passion for Gradual has grown out of that journey with Mozilla. Talk to me about: lifelong learning, critical theory, mushroom picking, Third World history, poetry, living in Indonesia or SA, hiking in Corsica and surfing."
