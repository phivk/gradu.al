bio: |-
  Life-long learner on a continuous pursuit towards bringing people together across disciplines. As an actor and theater maker I have experimented extensively with ensemble driven work, audience participation and ways to co-design devised immersive experiences. Gradual allows me to bring that playful energy into an even broader range of communities and learn from people like you!

  Let's talk about: sailing, lighthouses, gaming, contemporary theatre and dance practitioners, acting methodologies, chess, living in NYC, London or Amsterdam.
