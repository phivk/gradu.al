bio: |-
  Kristin has performed Off-Broadway and Off-West End, and is a voice actor. On her return from New York to the UK in 2019, she began her theatre company, Bound By Theatre, and took a sell-out show SMOKE to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Her work deals with some of the challenging topics we may find uncomfortable and which we often avoid. Her original piece, Ghislaine/Gabler, won Best International Show at United Solo Theatre Festival in November 2021, and is set to appear for a full run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe this summer.

  Kristin co-founded krēan(t)s with RADA classmates Jack Parris and Lane Paul Stewart, whose work The Cinnamon Shop has been produced for The Coronet Theatre’s Outside In Festival and at the Bloomsbury Festival. She is an Associate Artist with Invulnerable Nothings.
