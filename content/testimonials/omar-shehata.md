quote: "I enjoyed being put in contact with someone I didn’t know within the community as gettingmeaningful connections in virtual settings is hard. It happened to be that our skills and interests were very complimentary and that was incredibly valuable to me, even if it wouldn’t have led to us hosting a session together."
