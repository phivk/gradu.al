quote: "Coming across Gradual was instrumental for my personal development. It directly influenced our communal engagement and I loved how open, inquisitive and assertive we all became because of it. Facilitating a session with someone I didn’t know before made me feel truly connected. I never felt like I could ask 'stupid questions'… we were all there to learn together."
