quote: "One of the unexpected joys of using Gradual as a communal video repository is seeing our collection grow over time! It's amazing to have everything we've learned together - all our resources and experiences and insights - all in one place. And they're accessible to new community members, too. Gradual integrated quite well with other systems we had in place, so it's been easy to use."
