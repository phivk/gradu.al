The Interledger Foundation’s Grant for the Web program has announced 27 recipients from their most recent call for proposals - and we’re proud to announce that we’re amongst the successful grantees!

All of the chosen projects share a vision for practical activity to catalyze innovative business models for the web that expand financial inclusion.

## Growing together

In fast-moving, innovative domains - like the Web Monetization community - technical systems and the knowledge required to contribute are often so dynamic that structured learning resources aren't widely available.

We will strive to empower members in the Web Monetization community with a safe and accessible space to learn with others as we grow into a healthy, social and connected ecosystem. This project will support the community of current GftW grantees in their social learning needs, using the Gradual skill sharing process and web-based tooling.

We will integrate a skill sharing process and tool into the Grant for the Web cohort community, in order to equip grantees with a space to express any topics they'd like to learn and share while they are working on their projects. The resulting learning sessions, led by members of the grantee community, might relate directly to the Web Monetization API and its implementation, or to any broader topics.

## The months ahead

We can’t wait to start learning more about Web Monetization and the impact it can have in the coming months with fellow grantees. It’s an incredibly diverse, international crew with projects that range from an exploration of gift cards for the internet driven by Web Monetization to experiments with new business models for sustainable, free trade coffee production in West Africa.
