We are excited to partner with Mozilla again to host the Emergent Encounters Experience at [MozFest 2023](https://www.mozillafestival.org/). Building on the momentum and insights from the Emergent Sessions track we ran at MozFest 2022, we are bringing together MozFest participants through emergent encounters, based on shared interests that are gradually discovered throughout the festival.

## Welcome to the Gardens of MozFest

The internet is much like a garden: a living, breathing ecosystem that's constantly in flux. And just like a garden, we have to take care of the internet. We have to nurture it, protect it, and preserve it for future generations. This is where the MozFest participants come in!

We are inviting people to gather around the themes of Movement Building, Transparency, Data Stewardship and Bias. Each day Monday through Thursday has two themed **Happy Hours** ðŸŒ± on Spatial Chat, where people can gather, meet and share ideas in different forms. You can find them on the official Mozilla Festival schedule [here](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/schedule?query=Happy%20Hour).

We will gather the most nutritious input into what we call 'the greenhouse' for a **Greenhouse Harvesting Party** ðŸŽ‰ [on Friday](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/session/L38773-1) to take stock at what we've learned over the week and look forward to the road ahead.
