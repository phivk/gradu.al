We are excited to partner with Mozilla again to host the Emergent Encounters Experience at [MozFest 2023](https://www.mozillafestival.org/). Building on the momentum and insights from the Emergent Sessions track we ran at MozFest 2022, we are bringing together MozFest participants through emergent encounters, based on shared interests that are gradually discovered throughout the festival.

The internet is much like a garden: a living, breathing ecosystem that's constantly in flux. And just like a garden, we have to take care of the internet. We have to nurture it, protect it, and preserve it for future generations. This is where the MozFest participants come in!

We are inviting people to gather around the themes of Movement Building, Transparency, Data Stewardship and Bias. Each day Monday through Thursday has two **Happy Hours** ðŸŒ± dedicated to a theme, where people can gather, meet and share ideas in different forms. You can find them on the schedule here:
https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/schedule?query=Happy%20Hour

We will gather the most nutritious input into the greenhouse for a **Greenhouse Harvesting Party** ðŸŽ‰ on Friday to take stock at what we've learned over the week and look forward to the road ahead:
