There's a lot of momentum around Artificial Intelligence and its implementations at the moment and I'm not even remotely going to pretend that I feel confident in fully understanding the impact this will have on our functioning societies. Some of the hype may be entirely overblown and yet some of it may demands your attention. As with any revolutionary emerging technology: it's going to take time to adapt the way we live, work and learn. However, considering the exponential growth of technology we're currently experiencing, ample time may become a commodity we can't continue to take for granted.

When Philo and I started Gradual we wanted to build something that makes us more resilient, the type of resilience that gives us the mental acumen to face the challenges of being required to continuously adapt in a world of constant flux. We understood also that true adapting requires communal effort and that this collaborative undertaking to learn together will ultimately need to be done so that it aligns with humanity's best interests.

It is then no surprise that the beginnings of Gradual go hand-in-hand with our journey at MozFest, which we've [written about before](https://www.gradu.al/blog/our-mozfest-story). The Mozilla Festival is one of those events that activist tech enthusiasts look forward to every year as it brings together an incredibly diverse group of individuals to explore together how the internet can be harnessed for good and nurture ideas to fight for internet health together.

This year

  
  
The Mozilla Festival is one of those events that every tech enthusiast looks forward to, and this year's event did not disappoint. The event brought together a diverse group of individuals, including botanists Philo van Kemenade and Ola Bonati, to explore how we can harness the power of AI for good. What made this year's event stand out was the Emergent Encounters track that hosted an idea for a virtual garden where participants became gardeners and nurtured their ideas through shared interests and fighting for internet health together.

At MozFest, participants had the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and build momentum around their passions and projects. While the event can be overwhelming at times, it provides a platform for diverse perspectives and fosters relationships between attendees.

Last year's MozFest was a testament to the value of building connections around shared curiosity. The Gradual tool and process, a communal skill sharing project, connected attendees around common interests, and resulted in unique pairings of people exchanging contact details for further engagement. This year, the Emergent Encounters track built on this idea, creating a virtual garden where participants could come together and explore how to harness the power of AI for good.

The MozFest event is not just about the content of the sessions or the lessons that can be learned. The true value lies in the relationships and connections gained from sharing passions with like-minded people. The event provides an opportunity to build momentum around projects and prepare for sessions with someone new.

In the end, MozFest is an event that every tech enthusiast should attend. It's a place where you can find your people and start building momentum around your passions and projects. Whether it's the Emergent Encounters track or the Gradual tool and process, MozFest provides a platform for diverse perspectives, fosters relationships, and builds momentum around projects. So, mark your calendars for next year's MozFest, and don't miss the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals and build momentum around your passions.
