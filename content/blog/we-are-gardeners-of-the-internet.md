There's a lot of momentum around Artificial Intelligence and its implementations at the moment and I'm not even remotely going to pretend that I feel confident in fully understanding the impact this will have on our functioning societies. Some of the hype may be entirely overblown, some of it may demand your attention - but it seems clear that as with any revolutionary emerging technology it's going to take time to adapt the way we live, work and learn. Considering the exponential growth of technology we're currently experiencing however, it's time that may become a commodity we can't continue to take for granted.

When Philo and I started Gradual we wanted to build something that makes us more resilient, the type of resilience that gives us the mental acumen to face the challenges of being required to continuously adapt in a world of constant flux. We understood that true adaptation often requires communal effort and that this collaborative undertaking to learn together will ultimately need to be done so that it aligns with humanity's best interests.

It is no surprise then that the beginnings of Gradual go hand-in-hand with our journey at MozFest, which we've [written about before](https://www.gradu.al/blog/our-mozfest-story). The Mozilla Festival is one of those events that activist tech enthusiasts look forward to every year as it brings together an incredibly diverse group of individuals to explore together how the internet can be harnessed for good and nurture ideas to fight for internet health together.

With MozFest 2023 having come to an end it wraps up our 3rd official collaboration with Mozilla as partners. This year, we wanted to do things [slightly differently](https://www.gradu.al/blog/welcome-to-emergent-encounters-at-mozfest-2023). In this blog I'll briefly lay out how the process to design and host a virtual garden gained traction within the community to fight for internet health together.

## From Garden to Greenhouse

While the event can be overwhelming at times, it provides an excellent platform for diverse perspectives as it fosters relationships between its attendees. Sessions are hosted, games are played, music is performed... let's just say that lots is happening all at once. And because MozFest has been a virtual event since 2021 it's easy to miss the type of moments of spontaneity that come with IRL events. 

Last year's Emergent Sessions track at MozFest was a testament to the value of building connections around shared curiosity. Our tool and process connected attendees around common interests and resulted in unique pairings of people exchanging contact details for further engagement. This year, the Emergent Encounters track built on this idea, creating a virtual garden where participants could come together and explore
