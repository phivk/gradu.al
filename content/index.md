## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome the Grant for the Web Skill Sharing Hub!

This is a space to express things youâ€™d like to learn and share with others in the community. Join the conversation on the [Interledger Slack](https://interledger.name/developer-tools/community/#slack) or the [community](https://community.webmonetization.org/) forum!

<process-card-list class="full-width"></process-card-list>

**Submit a skill** or **high five an existing one**. When multiple people share your interest, a session can emerge. Leave your [Interledger Slack](https://interledger.name/developer-tools/community/#slack) username and we'll help you turn your idea into **a next skill sharing session**!
