## Hi ðŸ‘‹ <br /> Welcome to Demo on Gradual!

<div class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 my-8">

Sometimes you come up with a great idea for a session _during_ the festival. Here's your chance to connect with others based on a spontaneous thought, a shared interest, a creative spark, a question or whatever else that inspires you!

<process-card-list class="full-width"></process-card-list>

**Submit an idea** or **high five an existing one**. When multiple people share your interest, a session can emerge. Leave your username of the [MozFest Slack](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/slack/) and we'll help you turn your idea into **a session on the emergent [schedule](https://schedule.mozillafestival.org/emergent-sessions)**!
