Sometimes you come up with a great idea for a session _during_ the festival. Here's your chance to connect with others based on a spontaneous thought, a shared interest, a creative spark, a question or whatever else that inspires you!

**Submit an idea** or **high five an existing one**. When multiple people share your interest, a session can emerge. Leave your username of the [MozFest Slack](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/slack/) and you will be contacted to turn your idea into **a session on the emergent schedule**!

Any questions? Join the conversation in the [#emergent-sessions channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T170JCUN6/C01PXSJ9AH0) on the [MozFest Slack](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/slack/).
