## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome the Grant for the Web Skill Sharing Hub!

This is a space to express things youâ€™d like to learn and share with others in the community. Join the conversation on the
[community](https://community.webmonetization.org/) forum!

**Submit a skill** or **high five an existing one**. When multiple people share your interest, a session can emerge. Leave your username of the [Web Monetization Community Forum](https://community.webmonetization.org/) and we'll help you turn your idea into **a next skills sharing session**!
