bio: Lifelong learning across disciplines is vital for our evolving world, inspiration from inspiring individuals, fostering curiosity (can’t be curious if you don’t have a teaser for other areas first!). My own specializations fall in marketing/social media marketing/relationship marketing; creating engaging online learning environments (utilizing existing tools - not creating new tools); effective teaching in in-person, hybrid, or online environments; experience design for live events.
