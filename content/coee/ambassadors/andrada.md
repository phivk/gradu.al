bio: For me this summer is about learning things for fun. Anything from composting, growing a garden, to making macrame or learning about NLP, there's no limit. This state of exploration makes me feel like a wondrous child who is simply enjoying being alive. It's also helping me reframe my fear of not being an expert at something. So I'm hoping to spread this love of learning for the sake of the process this summer with many of our extraordinary alumni.
