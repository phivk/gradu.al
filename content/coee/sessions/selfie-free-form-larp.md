An intimate game about feelings in images. This is a roleplay game similar to guided improvisation. After the shared game experience we will share reflections on how larp in this form can be used to prompt insights and frame topics of conversations and how to design for intimate experiences like this. 

3–5 players; 90 min incl. reflections & take-aways.
