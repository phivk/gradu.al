Many of us have experimented and have had mixed results with podcasting. Some of us even participated in ol' school terrestrial radio. 

In this facilitated peer share session we will discuss the following topics and share our experiences and tips: 

**1. Technical kit for podcast recording and mastering** 

**2. Content and structure that captivates listeners** 

**3. Converting listeners to buyers** 

Bring your ideas, experiences and questions about podcasting to the group and we will help discover and improve together: September 8th | 5pm CEST, 11am EDT, 8am PDT.
