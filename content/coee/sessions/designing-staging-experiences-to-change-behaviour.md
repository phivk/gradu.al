Bring a story of an experience that was designed (not exclusively by you) to change your behaviour, and did so successfully. How & why did it work?

This workshop has two sessions:

* Tuesday 10/8 at 16:00 CEST
* Thursday 12/8 at 15:00 CEST

with the second session building on the results of the first.
