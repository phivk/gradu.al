What does the future of research and scholarship look like, and how can interactive media play a role? In this session, we'll have a conversation discussing the role creative interactive web experiences can (and already do) have on scholarship. From interactive visualizations as an output, to creative ways of exploring research data, there are a variety of ways interactivity can transform scholarship. We'll discuss topics such as the current trends, the future of this space, challenges, and cool examples.

Come prepared with some thoughts, possible discussion points, interesting examples, and/or an interest in exploring this space!
