## Welcome 👋

Welcome to the <content-text :text='communityName'></content-text> Gradual instance!

Read on for **ambassador instructions** on how to add new sessions using the CMS. Or head for the [home page](/) to see what you can learn and share.

## Sign in to the CMS

Every instance has one or more _ambassadors_ with access to the **Content Management System (CMS)**. As an ambassador, you should have received an email invitation to set up your account.

## Adding and editing sessions via the CMS

Once you're logged in to the Forestry CMS, you can access <span style="color: #00ae86;">**Sessions**</span> via the left sidebar:

![Accessing sessions in the CMS](https://www.gradu.al/img/gradual-cms-sessions.png "Access sessions via the left sidebar")

Click a session or hit the **'Create new'** button to edit a session's <span style="color: #00ae86;">**Front Matter**</span> (left) and <span style="color: #00ae86;">**Markdown**</span> (right):

Information about your content is called <span style="color: #00ae86;">**Front Matter**</span> in Forestry. Each type of content can have different information attached. The CMS makes it easy to fill in the bits you need. You can [read more about Front Matter here](https://forestry.io/docs/editing/front-matter/).

Your content's body text is written in <span style="color: #00ae86;">**Markdown**</span>. The CMS offers a helpful editor to style your text the way you like. You can [read more about editing Markdown content in the Forestry CMS here](https://forestry.io/docs/editing/front-matter/).

## Previewing and publishing

When you are happy with your edits, you can hit the 'save' button top right.

You can also preview your edits via the preview button top right:

![Gradual CMS Preview](https://www.gradu.al/img/gradual-cms-preview.png "Preview your edits")

This will open a preview of the Gradual site in a new window (wait for it to build), where you can navigate to see your changes.
