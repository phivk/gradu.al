gFam.live aims to introduce new storytellers into the web monetization community with its social media posts, and now new functionality called gFam Learn will attempt to enable teachers to earn directly from students via web monetization and/or tips. 

Adam Waring will present the gFam Learn functionality and answer any questions you might have on the processes or technology. As far as we're aware there is no capacity or platform online for teachers to earn per lesson or for students to unlock and pay for just the lessons they're interested in. With gFam Learn, lessons can be visible to everyone and tips/microtransactions are provided as a bonus or lessons can be gated and unlocked by either Coil Subscribers or by a specified amount of XRP via the XUMM wallet.
