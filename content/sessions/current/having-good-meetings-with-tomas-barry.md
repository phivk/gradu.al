A playful tutorial in the basics of having productive business meetings.

"No matter what work you're in, meetings are a fact of life, and it's vital to know how to do them well. In this session, I will share some of what I've learnt as a partner in a co-operative agency, in various theatre companies, and in local activism: how to speak for yourself, listen to others, agree decisions and find compromise. My hope is that you will leave with an idea of how you can organically agree rules with others to suit the needs & context of any meeting.‚Äù
