## About this event

We’re excited to continue our monthly series of community engagements and are pleased to invite you to our next Community Call on **June 23, 2022 at 4:00 pm EDT / 8:00 pm GMT-3** hosted by Grant for the Web awardee Andrey Torres of project PipeWebMonetization.

Andrey and guest speakers Gabriel Eiji and Danilo Mirandawill will lead a conversation about Web monetization into the WordPress ecosystem.

Have you ever tried to use the web monetization technology in your WordPress website? Was it hard for you? Come here to talk and learn about the utilization of the web monetization technology into the WordPress ecosystem.

Andrey’s project, [PipeWebMonetization](https://community.webmonetization.org/pipe/pipewebmonetization-grant-report-1-4acn), will facilitate the insertion of Web Monetization in the development of websites by leveraging WordPress, creating the possibility of users to leverage their existing businesses and websites by adding a possible new form of income through Web Monetization. The project will be successful when WordPress users, be they power users or not, can easily implement Web Monetization in their businesses.

**_Agenda:_**

- Introduce the PipeWebMonetization project
- Talk about our technologies and infrastructure
- Talk about our discoveries and interviews across the WordPress Community
- Talk about Future
- Q&A section

This call will be an hour. We will use Zoom and collaborative note taking for this event. We acknowledge that for a global community this time may not be friendly to all timezones so we will be recording the call to share and commit to moving these monthly meetings to different times going forward.

This is an ongoing series of live community gatherings that will focus on building connections, sharing knowledge, and advancing the Web Monetization ecosystem.

We do hope you can join us!
