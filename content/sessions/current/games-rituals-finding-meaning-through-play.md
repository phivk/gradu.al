An exploration of how we find sense & meaning in randomness through deliberate action.

"This experiment in devising follows the work I began with my Manifesto group, Undertow Collective, during my time in Theatre Lab. We'll play a few familiar group games, moving gradually between competing & co-operating as performative modes. Then finish with an opportunity to devise together from scratch, following the same path. This session will be physically active, but not strenuous: not out of breath, but chasing it. I hope to offer you something fun & new (feedback will be most welcome)"
