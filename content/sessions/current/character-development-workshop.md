_*trigger warning - centres around family dynamics, mother/child relationships/abuse. This will not necessarily be explicitly discussed but is the theme of the work*_

A character development workshop centred around Attachment Theory.

Don’t worry if you don’t know anything about it. Feel free to read a bit about it before the workshop - or not. It’s primarily an acting workshop.

I would like actors to improvise scenes and be hot-seated.  
I have some clear characters and scenes I’d like to work with but I’m open to your ideas too.

I may like to voice record some improvisations for script development so ideally you’ll be ok with this. If you would like to take part but don’t want to be recorded please let me know at the start of the workshop or feel free to message me beforehand.

To make sure everyone has the chance to work, I can only have 8 participants max but I’m happy for anyone to spectate.

Please get in touch if you’d like to take part: [miriamelwellsutton@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:miriamelwellsutton@yahoo.co.uk)

Attachment theories propose that the physical attachment between parent (typically the mother) and child leads to a sense of physical and psychological security. Non responsive or rejecting interactions with a caretaker lead the child to feel anxiety, insecurity, and low self-esteem. These psychological insecurities inhibit the child’s formation of satisfying relationships with others, including, eventually, his or her own children. Thus, attachment theorists propose that neglecting and abusive behaviors are transmitted across generations. Attachment theory has been criticized for a failure to conceptualize family dynamics other than the mother–child dyad and to integrate social and cultural factors such as poverty and unemployment. However, attachment theory’s emphasis on psychological security and interpersonal relationships is an important contribution to an understanding of the psychodynamics of abuse.
