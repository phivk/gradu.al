[Hessel van Oorschot](https://community.webmonetization.org/hessel) and [Meghan Laclé](https://community.webmonetization.org/meghan) of \[Free Music [Archive.](https://community.webmonetization.org/freemusicarchive) hosted Tuesday’s Community Call. 

It was an insightful discussion on how they are creating avenues to empower self-releasing artists and spend time with the participants to share opinions and (our) lessons learned. 

**_About Free Music Archive_**  
 Free Music Archive (FMA) is an iconic, free to access, music portal attracting half a million visitors a day. While artists, netlabels and curators can already release their music under their own terms on FMA we want to push forward: FMA Next will empower creators and curators to engage with their audience, experiment with multiple revenue streams and stay in control of their valuable assets and data.
