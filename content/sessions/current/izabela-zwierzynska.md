Find your potential and let it flow.

Discover yourself.

This is a workshop based on psychological background, coaching and acting.

The aim is to help you to define your authentic code â€“ the way you came across as an artist, how you express yourself and define what you want to express.

We will start with a meditation, which you can try to do later at home and physical warm up. There will be some strategies to define your artistic objective and tips on how to increase your level of motivation. We will be sharing and exploring what works. The aim of the workshop is to empower participants as artists, unlock their potential and inspire each other. We will also explore the ideas of charisma on stage.

Wear comfy clothes as we will be moving, potentially also on the floor.
