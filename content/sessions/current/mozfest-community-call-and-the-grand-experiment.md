The [Grant for the Web](https://community.webmonetization.org/grantfortheweb) Program Team [Chris](https://community.webmonetization.org/chrislarry) & [Erika](https://community.webmonetization.org/erikad), with help from awardees [Erica Hargreave](https://community.webmonetization.org/ericahargreave) of [StoryToGo](https://storytogo.ca/) and [Gradual's](https://community.webmonetization.org/gradual) [Philo](https://community.webmonetization.org/phivk) & [Gunnar](https://community.webmonetization.org/gunnar) hosted the MozFest Edition Community Call.

This was a great opportunity to learn about the Grand MozFest Web Monetization Experiment, how to participate in the tipping beta, how you can make sure your content and projects can participate and be available for tips from MozFest Participants, and how to help advocate and talk to others about Web Monetization and your projects.

[**_MozFest_**](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/) is fully virtual this year, and all ticket holders (last year there were 10,000+) will be given a free Coil account, prepopulated with $10 USD of credits that can be used to stream micropayments and to tip single amounts. Our aim is to use these peer-to-peer payments across the festival to introduce attendees to Interledger and Web Monetization technology while supporting resources benefitting the free and open web.
