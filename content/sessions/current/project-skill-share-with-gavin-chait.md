## About this event

We are excited to bring our next Project Skill Sharing community event hosted by awardee Gavin Chait of Qwyre on Monday, April 25 at 10:00 am EST.

Join Gavin Chait, author and developer of Qwyre.com, as he shares his experience in developing for monetization, and offers guidance and thoughts on how to integrate the APIs into your own mobile project. Also, learn about African science fiction, and share a coffee during this event.

**Web Monetization for Mobile, streaming ebooks on Qwyre.com**

Streaming means deliberately breaking data into chunks and streaming those in a format that permits live, iterative, building of the digital object from these chunks while also serving the content in that dynamic object. For text, and ebooks specifically, that means a stream of words. Except they also have to carry markup so they're formatted properly on arrival.

And, because most people read on mobile devices, we need to support web monetization in a mobile browser where most people don't use the only browser which natively supports monetization.

**_Agenda:_**

* Intro to Qwyre
* Demo of Qwyre.com,
* Design considerations for the workflow in reading and monetization,
* API gotchas for mobile, as well as refreshing tokens and ensuring continuity for the reader, - Future development, including ways in which the monetization API can be improved,
* Drink coffee, tell stories.
* Q&A

This call will be an hour long and will take place on Zoom and will be recorded. We acknowledge that for a global community this time may not be friendly to all timezones so we will be recording the call to share and commit to moving these monthly meetings to different times going forward.

You and your team can register (free) this event. The Zoom link will be shared in the Eventbrite invite and note taking document to all those who register for the session ahead of the call.

We hope you can join us!

**_About Qwyre:_**

Qwyre is a collaborative publishing platform, allowing authors to earn streaming micropayments as people read their work. And we can do this because of Web Monetization.
