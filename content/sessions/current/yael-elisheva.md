Ever wondered if you could be a comedic genius? The next Josie Lawrence or Wayne Brady if you will? Well then this class is certainly not for you.

This class is for us simple human folk looking to play games, learn the basic rules of improv, and improvise our way into short-form sketches. We’ll mingle with other unremarkably funny people looking to expand their comedic tool set…maybe even start a rock band.
