GftW Awardee [Kult's](https://community.webmonetization.org/kult) [Patrick Rahy](https://community.webmonetization.org/patrickrahy) & [Helena Tude](https://community.webmonetization.org/helenatude)  
 hosted our first Community Call of the new year.

Patrick and Helena discussed how they are already implementing Web Monetization on Kult as well as future possibilities for this amazing technology on the platform. [Kult.com.br](https://kult.com.br/login) offers a space to share, discover, and save books, movies, TV series, songs, and podcasts, while monetizing content curators with micropayments via Web Monetization/Interledger Protocol.

**_About Kult_**  
Kult is a network-based platform for culture & entertainment content curation supported by a community-rewarding system. We believe that human curation is the best way to discover and promote amazing content online. We give voice to people instead of letting algorithms decide what is worth our time.
