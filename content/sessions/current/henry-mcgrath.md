Henry McGrath will be leading a workshop exploring ideas for his upcoming, 'The SKIIN Project' about the inner life of people who live with eczema. The project will be a dance-film collaborating with Vanhulle Dance Theatre and a spoken word artist from Gloucester. This workshop will focus on starting to unpack one of the project's major ideas of concealing truth and revealing it, looking into notions of mask and social identity. The workshop will be dynamic, explorative, and highly physical.
