Within our lives, we migrate across many worlds. For instance, ‘the world of childhood’—which envelops us with its tastes, smells and sounds when someone asks you a question as simple as ‘where did you grow up?’. Or the urban world of a big city like London or New York where everyone is a stranger. We think and behave differently to adapt and connect in these different spaces we simultaneously inhabit. I also believe that stories unfold in the journeys between these worlds. In this workshop, we will explore how the things we create as artists come from questioning the tensions between these worlds, and the way we fill these unknown gaps with our imagination: myths begin from the ‘stories we tell ourselves’. We will journey together to make our bodies available to intuition and imagination, we will lower our judgments on ourselves and each other, and we will explore the multitudinous worlds inside and outside you: to discover new seeds for creating theatre that is mythical, that awakens the imagination and allows us to collectively reach beyond the horizontal line of human drama and into the vertical line of heaven and hell: we will discover the comic and tragic, the mythic and the banal, the beautiful and ugly spaces on that axis. Although I will be facilitating your process of reflection and creation, they will be individual journeys in which you teach yourself.
