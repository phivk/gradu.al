    Talking about software development environments hosted in cloud. Tried this out on Art Design Fashion Project:
    
    * https://github.com/SlovakNationalGallery/art-design-fashion - see .devcontainer
    * https://artdesignfashion.moravska-galerie.cz/exhibitions/2
    
    Solutions available right now:
    
    GitHub Codespaces (https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces)
    
    * Seamless integration with GitHub (duh) and VS Code, prices start at $0.18/hour
    
    Coder.com (https://coder.com/)
    
    * Makes it possible to host dev environments on own infrastructure. However pricing is unclear.
    
    Gitpod (https://www.gitpod.io/)
    
    * https://www.gitpod.io/pricing
    * https://www.gitpod.io/for/opensource
    
    Other alternatives:
    * Dev container (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial)
