This weekâ€™s Community Call was hosted by [Erika Kitzmiller](https://community.webmonetization.org/ekitzmiller) and [Steven Goss](https://community.webmonetization.org/steve_g) for the 11/30 Youth Collaborative (formerly known as [Central PA Info Hub](https://community.webmonetization.org/ekitzmiller/project-name-grant-report-number-4nh2).

Thank you to all who attended and to [Erika](https://community.webmonetization.org/ekitzmiller) and [Steven](https://community.webmonetization.org/steve_g) for hosting the Community Call. It was an engaging event of ideas and thoughts shared about the potentials and limitations of web monetization for grassroots, community-based projects.
