[Erica Hargreave](https://community.webmonetization.org/ericahargreave) of [StoryToGo.ca](http://storytogo.ca/) with the creative help of [Pamela Alexander](https://community.webmonetization.org/palexander) [pamelajalexander.com](http://pamelajalexander.com/) and [Briana Stuart](https://community.webmonetization.org/creativelivingfordancers) [creativelivingfordancers.com](http://creativelivingfordancers.com/) hosted an conversation that was lighthearted, relaxed and mindfully filled session.

Participants did a meditation icebreaker led by Pamela, master of mindfulness and shared insight into how we are all helping to bridge connections in the Web Monetization community. Btw meditation rocks! Erica shared an update on the Web Monetisation Libraries on StoryToGo that she set up to help to begin connecting the projects. Briana shared with us her work and the connections she’s made throughout her project.
