During the Skill Share session, the MOVA team explained how their project links Web Monetisation with Open Video. The team also demonstrated for the first time two developments, a multi-step, multi-payee revenue sharing system and a a proposed decentralised registry of video fingerprints, matched with Payment Pointers, and other metadata such as Creative Commons license.
