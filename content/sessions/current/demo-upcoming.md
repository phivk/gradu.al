Remember show & tell? This is an opportunity to come together and share your creative work and get new inspiration from others!

<!--more-->

Gunnar will share some of their very creative work and have a conversation around how they've made it. Anyone is encouraged to join and share their recent artworks and crafts! Is painting mostly intuition- or crafts based? What would it be like to sit down and create some remote art together? Come find out and share your own work asynchronously on the separate Slack Channel!
