**Description of event**

We would love to invite any current or past GftW grantees to share some insights on things we have learned about Web Monetization so far. Any lessons gathered out of previous cohorts or current projects are welcome so together we can figure out how best to implement web monetization into our projects!

Feel free to use the collaborative doc for further participation.
