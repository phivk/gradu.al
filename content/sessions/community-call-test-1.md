On June 24, 2021 the GftW Program Team ([Ayesha,](https://community.webmonetization.org/ayeshaware) [Chris](https://community.webmonetization.org/chrislarry) & [Erika](https://community.webmonetization.org/erikad)) hosted the very first Community Call. During this first installment we shared updates, opportunities and invited 3 awardees to do project share-outs.

Community Calls and Project Skill Shares are times to gather as a network and discuss trends we are seeing, plan together, and hear updates from ecosystem projects. Community member(s) design, curate, and lead the session with logistical facilitation from the Grant for the Web Program Team.
