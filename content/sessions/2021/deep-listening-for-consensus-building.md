Deep Listening was one of the most sought after skills to learn more about, as you can see by the number of people who registered themselves as learners.

This is not surprising, considering how supportive, generous and inclusive the vibe at MozFest has been throughout these last two weeks. If there’s anything that has become abundantly clear at MozFest, it’s that inclusive internet makes for a more exciting planet to inhabit. How can we take a pro-active stance in nurturing seeds of deep listening in ourselves and others, ensuring that we can hear each other despite any difficulties that may arise? Melissa will host a conversation where you can share your insights and allow yourself to be present in the moment and deeply hear what’s alive for you and others in that moment. Due to perhaps the level of authenticity that could be gained from knowing that recordings aren’t being made and that everything stays in the room - this session will not be recorded.
